# Product

### ðŸ”µ What is it?
Random letter blocks are generated for this project and they vary with each run. Every time the system runs a random selection of letters or letter combinations is chosen. These blocks can be used for a number of things including procedurally generated content placeholder text and name generation.

### ðŸ”µ Moderation
Every set undergoes a filtering script to make sure the generated letter combinations dont unintentionally create offensive or inappropriate words which could set off moderation filters or go against platform policies. This filter automatically removes or regenerates any letter blocks that contain problematic sequences by cross-referencing a list of flagged words or patterns. This protection enhances user experience and guarantees adherence to content standards.

### ðŸ”µ Creation Process
These letter blocks idea and execution were first thoroughly examined in an online forum where contributors and developers worked together to identify best practices and make suggestions for enhancements. Together with credits and acknowledgments to the community members and helper scripts that contributed to the filtering logic and generation mechanics a link to this forum thread will be provided for reference.

# Instructions

### ðŸ”µ What do you get?
By default this model offers three pre-made Random Letter Bricks each of which has a different runtime-selected letter combination. These form the foundation of your experience and can be freely reproduced as often as necessary to meet the requirements or design objectives of your game.

### ðŸ”µ Duplication Limitations
All duplicate bricks must however remain in the same model group. Because every brick has to go through an integrated text filtering system this is essential because it guarantees that the randomly generated letter combinations are secure and adhere to Robloxs moderation guidelines. The possibility of offensive or unmoderated content showing up in-game increases if the bricks are separated or removed from the group which could circumvent this filter.
